    I wrote the administrator's user interface for the web app. This interface
    allows the administrator to enter information about projects for which the
    institution is seeking funding. I used AngularJS to develop the page. The
    page performed user authentication and made HTTP requests to the backend
    (written in Python by a co-worker). I wrote tests using Capybara.
