    I wrote a cross-platform desktop application in Python for internal use at
    the company. It allows the selection of comparison groups of stocks and has
    a custom portfolio feature. It performs the calculations, then writes and
    graphs the data to an Excel sheet. In addition, it exports the data to Adobe
    Illustrator compatible XML for the publication of quarterly brochures. This
    calculator saves the company from maintaining several extensive spreadsheets
    and saves hours of manual graph data entry.


    I designed a workflow to improve the monthly process of producing pie charts
    for publication in brochures. I wrote a PHP script that queries a database
    and formats the data in XML. I then wrote Javascript to use the Variable
    Library feature of Adobe Illustrator to load the data file and export each
    chart individually. This again saves many hours of manual data entry.
