    The suite of apps built by PenyoPal were written in Lua and use the MOAI SDK
    to build for iOS and Android. I added features to an existing game. I then
    developed a suite of mini-games that were built on top of an existing game
    engine. Finally, I took the lead on my own app, Baby Kirin. It is a virtual
    pet type app and I designed a nondeterministic finite state machine to
    determine the state of the pet. I worked closely with designers to obtain
    requirements as to how the game should play.
