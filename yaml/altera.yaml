    I was in the I/O Subsytems team in IP and Device Software at Altera. Our
    team owned the I/O related IPs and all the software required to support it.
    Our responsibilites included: device modeling, compilation support,
    simulation support and hardware support.

    During my intership, I was primarily responsible for Design Intent
    integration.  This is a key role in the development of Quartus, Altera's CAD
    tool for programming FPGAs. My secondary role was to pipeclean the flow and
    then continue bringup of our IPs on the new family of devices, Stratix 10.
    Through this experience, I gained a lot of insight into the operation of
    FPGAs and some of the challenges of modeling the physical design in the CAD
    software.
